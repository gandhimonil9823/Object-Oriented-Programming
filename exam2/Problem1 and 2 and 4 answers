Problem 1
1) Two subclasses - Byte,short
2) Two methods - byteValue(), shortValue()
3) Because the methods byteValue and shortValue could be redefined as per changing certain steps in the concrete class which extends the number superclass

Problem 2
Decorator:

Name in Design Pattern | Actual Name
====================================
Component              |MoveableShape
ConcreteComponent      |CarShape,MoveableIcon
Decorator              |BoxedShape
method()               |draw()

Composite:

Name in Design Pattern | Actual Name
====================================
Primitive              |MoveableSape
Composite              |CompoundShape
Leaf                   |CarShape,MoveableIcon
method()               |A method of the MoveableShape such as move()

Strategy:

Name in Design Pattern | Actual Name
====================================
Context                |Animation,Animation2,Animation3,Animation4,Animation5,Animation6,Animation7
Strategy               |MoveStrategy
ConcreteStrategy       |SimpleMoveStrategy,CompoundMoveStrategy, CrazyMoveStrategy
doWork()               |process(List<MoveableShape> shapes)

Problem 4

b) No this is not an example of Decorator pattern because it does not modify the decoratior class mathod
 
c) This is an templeate method pattern example as it changes calls the required methods form its mousePressed methods
