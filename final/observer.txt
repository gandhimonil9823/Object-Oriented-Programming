Question 2

Yes it is an example of Observer Pattern, as you can see the EventHandler interface is the "Observer" and one the setOnAction is called the Button which is the "Subject" is notified and

Subject - Button
Observer - EventHandler
ConcreteObserver - Class which implements the EventHandler
attach() - handle(ActionEvent e)
notify() - setOnAction
