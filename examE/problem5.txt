Name in Design Pattern |   Actual Name
=====================================================
Aggregate              |   none
ConcreteAggregate      |   InputStream, String, File
Iterator               |   Iterator<String>
ConcreteIterator       |   Scanner
createIterator()       |   new Scanner(...)
next()                 |   next()
isDone()               |   opposite of hasNext()
currentItem()          |   Return value of next()

The pattern doesn't fully apply because the classes that can
be used with a scanner don't have a common interface. (There
is no "Scannable".)
